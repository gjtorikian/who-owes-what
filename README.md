# who-owes-what

I got tired of seeing big corporations (GitHub, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce) using my open source software without sponsoring. I wrote this little CLI to detect major dependents with their points of contact, so that I could ask them for funds.

Also, I wanted to try a Typescript project.

Detailed README forthcoming?
